#TAKPROTO

This repo handles an inter agent message definition based on the ATAK COT message
definition in protobuf format. The ATAK definition lacks direct tasking and 
handling of commands for controlling agents and seems to be more for sharing information
generated by agents (usually humans, sometimes drones).

This repo extends the takproto located [in the Android Tactical Assault Kit-CIV github repo](https://github.com/deptofdefense/AndroidTacticalAssaultKit-CIV/tree/master/takproto)
so should be fine for transmission via the various mechanisms ATAK message routing 
such as Free TAK server and use with client libraries such as pyTAK.
